                  <p><strong>1. View the current status of code authorship data:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>The report generated by the tool is available at <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/dashboard">Project Code Dashboard</a>.</strong> The feature that is most relevant to you is the <em>Code Panel</em> (shown on the right side of the screenshot above). It shows the code attributed to a given author. You are welcome to play around with the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#interpreting-the-report">other features</a>.</li>
                    <li>Click on your name to load the code attributed to you (based on Git blame/log data) onto the code panel on the right.</li>
                    <li>If the code shown roughly matches the code you wrote, all is fine and there is nothing for you to do.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>2. If the code does not match:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Here are the possible reasons for the code shown not to match the code you wrote:
                      <ul>
                        <li>the <code>git username</code> in some of your commits does not match your GitHub username (perhaps you missed our instructions to set your Git username to match GitHub username earlier in the project, or GitHub did not honor your Git username for some reason)</li>
                        <li>the actual authorship does not match the authorship determined by git blame/log e.g., another student touched your code after you wrote it, and Git log attributed the code to that student instead</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>3. You can run RepoSense locally:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You can install reposense from the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/releases">releases page</a>, and generate the report locally to check.</li>
                    <li>Use the two methods described in the RepoSense User Guide section <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#configuring-a-repo-to-provide-additional-data-to-reposense">Configuring a Repo to Provide Additional Data to RepoSense</a> to provide additional data to the authorship analysis to make it more accurate.
                      <ul>
                        <li>If you add a <code>config.json</code> file to your repo (as specified by one of the two methods):
                          <ul>
                            <li>If your commits have multiple author names, specify all of them e.g., <code>&quot;authorNames&quot;: [&quot;theMyth&quot;, &quot;theLegend&quot;, &quot;theGary&quot;]</code></li>
                            <li><mark>If updating the config file as described above results in an accurate report, pass the list of <code>authorNames</code> to the lecturer so that the centralized dashboard can be updated to reflect the contributions accurately.</mark></li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If you add <code>@@author</code> annotations, please follow the guidelines show below.</li>

                          The <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicates the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.
                          Here is a sample code file:</p>

The author of code below yours can add the GitHub username to the empty tag later.
                          Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>

                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Annotate both functional and test code</strong> There is no need to annotate documentation files.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a method.</span> <br> <strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong> but allowed. If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to annotate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                          <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                          <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
                          <li>💡 GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>

                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Do not try to boost the quantity of your contribution using unethical means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.
                          Individual members are responsible for making sure code attributed to them are correct.
                          If you notice a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>

                        <p><strong>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product</strong>,</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>

                    <li>It should show a state in which the product is well-populated <span class="dimmed">i.e., don't leave data panels largely blank</span></li>
                    <li>Choose a state that showcase the main features of the product <span class="dimmed">i.e., the login screen is not usually a good choice</span></li>

                      <p><span class="dimmed">It's similar to giving extra details as appendices; the reader will look at the UG/DG if the PPP is not enough to make a judgment. For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></p>

                          <li>Note that significant project components are <strong>not graded solely based on peer ratings</strong>. Rather, PE data are mostly used to cross-validate tutors' grades and identify cases that need further investigation. When peer inputs are used for grading, they are usually combined with tutor evaluations with appropriate weight for each. In some cases ratings from team members are given a higher weight compared to ratings from other peers, if that is appropriate.</li>

                      <li>You will be graded based on your effectiveness as a tester (e.g., the percentage of the bugs you found, the nature of the bugs you found) and how far off your evaluation/estimates are from the evaluator consensus. <span class="dimmed">Explanation: we understand that you have limited expertise in this area; hence, we penalize only if your inputs don't seem to be based on a sincere effort to test/evaluate.</span></li>

                      <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</li>

                              <li>CATcher does not come with a UG, but the UI is fairly intuitive (there are tool tips too). Do post in the forum or ask in slack if you need any guidance with its usage.</li>
                              <li>Also note that CATcher hasn't been battle-tested for this phase, in particular, w.r.t. multiple team members editing the same issue concurrently. It is ideal if the team members get together and work through the issues together. If you think others might be editing the same issues at the same time, use the <code>Sync</code> button at the top to force-sync your view with the latest data from GitHub.
                              </li>

                          <li>Launch CATcher, and login to the profile <code>CS2113/T PE</code>. It will show all the bugs assigned to your team, divided into three sections:
                            <ol>
                              <li><code>Issues Pending Responses</code> - Issues that your team has not processed yet.</li>
                              <li><code>Issues Responded</code> - Your job is to get all issues to the second category.</li>
                              <li><code>Faulty Issues</code> - e.g., Bugs marked as duplicates of each other, or causing circular <em>duplicate</em> relationships. Fix the problem given so that no issues remain in this category.</li>
                            </ol>
                          </li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>PE Dry Run (at <strong>v1.3</strong>):
                        <ul>
                          <li>Test the product <mark>based on the User Guide</mark> (the UG is most likely accessible using the <code>help</code> command).</li>
                          <li>Do <mark><em>system</em> testing first</mark> <span class="dimmed">i.e., does the product work as specified by the documentation?</span>. If there is time left, you can <mark>do <em>acceptance</em> testing as well</mark> <span class="dimmed">i.e., does the product solve the problem it claims to solve?</span>.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>PE (at <strong>v1.4</strong>):
                        <ul>
                          <li>Test <mark>based on the Developer Guide</mark> (Appendix named <em>Instructions for Manual Testing</em>) <mark>and the User Guide</mark>. The testing instructions in the Developer Guide can provide you some guidance but if you follow those instructions strictly, you are unlikely to find many bugs. You can deviate from the instructions to probe areas that are more likely to have bugs.</li>
                          <li>As before, do both <mark>system testing and acceptance testing</mark> but give priority to system testing as system testing bugs can earn you more credit.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>These are considered <em>bugs</em></strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Behavior differs from the User Guide (or Developer Guide)</li>
                      <li>A legitimate user behavior is not handled <span class="dimmed">e.g. incorrect commands, extra parameters</span></li>
                      <li>Behavior is not specified and differs from normal expectations <span class="dimmed">e.g. error message does not match the error</span></li>
                      <li>The feature does not solve the stated problem of the intended user i.e., the feature is 'incomplete'</li>
                      <li>Problems in the User Guide e.g., missing/incorrect info</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>About posting <em>suggestions</em>:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>PE Dry Run (at <strong>v1.3</strong>): You can also post suggestions on how to improve the product. 💡 Be diplomatic when reporting bugs or suggesting improvements. For example, instead of criticising the current behavior, simply suggest alternatives to consider.</li>
                      <li>PE (at <strong>v1.4</strong>): Do not post suggestions. But if a feature is missing a critical functionality that makes the feature less useful to the intended user, it can be reported as a bug.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>How/where/when to report bugs</strong>:</p>

For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></p>

                  <li>We'll transfer the relevant bug reports to your repo over the weekend. Once you have received the bug reports for your product, it is up to you to decide whether you will act on reported issues before the final submission v1.4. For some issues, the correct decision could be to reject or postpone to a version beyond v1.4.</li>
                  <li>You can navigate to the original bug report (via the back-link provided in the bug report given to you) and post in that issue thread to communicate with the tester who reported the bug e.g. to ask for more info, etc. However, the tester is not obliged to respond.
                    <ul>
                      <li>💡 Do not argue with the issue reporter to try to convince that person that your way is correct/better. If at all, you can gently explain the rationale for the current behavior but do not waste time getting involved in long arguments. If you think the suggestion/bug is unreasonable, just thank the reporter for their view and close the issue.</li>
