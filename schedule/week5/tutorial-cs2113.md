**Suggested tutorial activities**

### Requirements analysis

- Present to your tutor and the other team your target user profile and the problem being solved.
- As a team, discuss user stores, use cases and non-functional requirements for your project.
- Present to your tutor and the other team some key user stories and use cases.

:bulb: **Use GitHub issue tracker to manage user stories**, but for that you need to set up your team's GitHub organization, project fork, and issue tracker first. Instructions for doing those steps are in the project tab.


<panel header="{{ icon_example }} User Story examples (from a different product)">

`As a user I can add a person by specifying the name only, so that I can record a contact in the contacts list.`

`As a user I can find the phone number by searching for the name, so that I can retrieve the contact details.`

`As a user I can delete a contact, so that I can get rid of stale contacts that I no longer care to maintain.`

`As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.`
