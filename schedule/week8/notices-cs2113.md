## Lecture this week

* **One part of this week's lecture is not covered in the textbook** and is relevant for your project. You are encouraged to attend this week's lecture even if you don't normally come to lectures.

## Tutorials

* Tutorials this week will be most effective if you work out the tutorial questions beforehand. You can discuss your answers with your team and your tutor during the tutorial.
* Some of the tutorial activities may be pushed to the following week.

## Project

* It is good that many of you have started some project planning and tracking leading up to v1.1.

* **You are expected to start proper project planning and tracking after v1.1**. 
<!--See [mid-v1.2 instructions]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w08-mid-v12.html) and please follow them carefully.-->

* **Try to achieve all milestone requirements, but do not fret if you miss a few**.   
  You will get full marks as long as you achieve about 60% of the milestone requirements on average.  
  Yes, that's a pretty low bar, but we have set it low in order to reduce workload and stress.  
  Ideally, you should achieve close to 80-90%.
