## RepoSense

- We use a new tool called `RepoSense` to identify your contributions to the project.
  - The tool is setup for the module and the report is available under the [project-dashboard link](https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/dashboard/). 

- Please check if your contributions are detected correctly in the dashboard.
- If you think all your contributions are not detected 
- Ensure your code is RepoSense compatible. [Instructions here]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w10-mid-v13.html).


- Follow the [user guide for RepoSense](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md) and fix the issues, if you don't see your contributions detected.
