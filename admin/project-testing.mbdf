* **Have a good screen grab tool** with annotation features so that you can quickly take a screenshot of a bug, annotate it, and post in the issue tracker.
  * :bulb: You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste a picture from the clipboard into a text box in GitHub issue tracker.

* **<span class="text-danger">Download the product to be tested</span>** <tooltip content="notifications are likely to go out on the morning of the PE/PE-D session">after you have been notified</tooltip> of which team you have been allocated to test.
  * ==Do this before you come to the testing session== to minimize the network clogging due to large number of downloads happening at once.

* **Charge your computer** before coming to the PE session. The testing venue (lecture theatre) does not have enough charging points.
