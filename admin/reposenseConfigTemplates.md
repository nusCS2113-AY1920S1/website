# Providing additional information to Reposense

In the current semester, we are automatically detecting the code authorship via our scripts.  
If you think your code contribution is not detected by reposense (as per the dashboard):
 * If your commits have multiple author names, specify all of them e.g., `"authorNames": ["theMyth", "theLegend", "theGary"]`
 * please contact the lecturer with specific details of the `git username` you used to commit your code.

You can find the git username using the command `git config user.name` within the directory containing your repository.

# Config templates
%%**If you need to create a `_reposense/config.json` file for your team repo**, use the json code given below (pick the one that matches your team) as the starting point of that file's content. Reason: the template code has the exact abbreviated name we use to identify you.%%
