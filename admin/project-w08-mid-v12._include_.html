      <box>
        <p>ðŸ’¡ <strong>You are free to adjust <em>process rigor</em> and <em>project plan</em> at any future time in the project</strong>, starting from v1.2.<br>
          If you are not sure if a certain adjustment is allowed, you can check with the lecturer first.
        </p>
      </box>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Adjust process rigor to suit your team's pace:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Switch to a lighter workflow:</strong> While forking workflow is the safest, it can be heavy. You can switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow is slowing you down.<br>
              Refer the textbook to find more about alternative workflows: branching workflow, centralized workflow.<br>
              However, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce automated checks</strong>: You can also reduce the rigor of checkstyle checks to expedite PR processing.</li>
            <li><strong>You can also increase the rigor/safety of your workflow</strong> in the following ways:
              <ul>
                <li>Use GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/"><em>Protected Branches</em></a> feature to protect your <code>master</code> branch against rogue PRs.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Adjust project plan if necessary</strong>. By now you will have a some idea about the code base and the product that you envisoned. You can revisit the feature release plan and adjust it if necessary.</p>

              <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>

                      <p>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks. Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign aÂ single personÂ to doÂ within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Do not track things taken for granted. <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track.

There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.<br><br></li>
